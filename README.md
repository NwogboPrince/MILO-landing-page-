## 🚀 About This Project

This project was created as a showcase of my frontend skills, especially in using **Tailwind CSS** for rapid, utility-first styling.  
It features a clean, professional design for the MILO brand, including:

- **Responsive Navbar** with mobile menu and modal login
- **Animated Hero/Banner Section**
- **Image Carousel**
- **Achievements Section** (with icons and stats)
- **Nutrition Section**
- **Global Network Section**
- **Footer** with newsletter signup and social icons
- **Login Modal** and **Sign Up Page** (with modal navigation)
- **AOS Animations** for engaging scroll effects

---

## 🛠️ How It Was Built

- **HTML5** for semantic structure
- **Tailwind CSS** for all styling and layout
- **Flowbite** for carousel and UI components
- **Font Awesome** for icons
- **AOS** for scroll animations
- **Vanilla JavaScript** for modal and mobile menu logic

All code is organized for clarity and maintainability, with a focus on accessibility and mobile-first design.

## 📱 Responsive Design

Every section is fully responsive, ensuring a seamless experience on desktops, tablets, and mobile devices.  
The navbar, hero/banner, carousel, and footer all adapt gracefully to any screen size.

- **Improve my Tailwind CSS skills** and learn best practices for utility-first CSS
